      <title>Houston, we have notes!</title>

      <description>In addition to the articles, I‚Äôve decided to add a notes section to the website now. There are times when I wanted to write a short piece about something but it didn‚Äôt feel right to put it in the articles section of the website.
Sometimes I just want to‚Ä¶note something down.
Hence the notes section!
What are notes meant to be? Notes will be short pieces of writing. Most likely a couple of lines long.</description>

      <description>You should be using an adblocker.
Not because ads are bad (although some are really annoying), but because even the FBI recommend using one for security now.
Use uBlock Origin and block those scam adverts that pop up at the top of search results.</description>

      <description>I really enjoy reading books on my Kindle. I also buy most of my digital books via Amazon. I never thought about making DRM-free copies of my eBooks until I read about how an engineer has his Amazon account suspended due to a delivery driver&amp;rsquo;s false claim.
That really got me thinking about how I would feel if I lost access to my Amazon account. I‚Äôve purchased most of my ebooks from Amazon.</description>

      <description>I took 9 weeks off work. Of those 9 weeks, I spent 8 travelling. This is a summary of how I found my time off and what I did, things I learnt from my first long-term travel trip and my favourite highlights.
What is sabbatical leave? A quick 101 - sabbatical leave is an extended period of time away from work. Common reasons for taking sabbatical leave are to pursue interests outside of work; such as travelling, studying, volunteering or even just to take a break to just rest.</description>

      <description>My Hugo website uses the Digital Garden Hugo theme but I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few changes in addition to using the theme. I&amp;rsquo;ve listed these changes below both for myself to refer back to and for anyone else that might find these useful to include in their own Hugo website üëáüèΩ
Updating lastmod text One of the first changes I made was to change the lastmod front matter text that was displayed on the theme.</description>

      <description>Please note
Due to issues with the theme, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to remove the code blocks from this article. The code is still present below but it&amp;rsquo;s not formatted as a code block. I&amp;rsquo;ll update this once this issue is fixed.
In the last few months, there has been a flurry of activity around personal blogs and owning your own data, since Musk took the reins of Twitter.
With that, a lot of people have been wondering how they can start their own websites.</description>

      <description>Time and time again, we are shown that we cannot rely on third-party platforms to host our content.
The internet is constantly changing and with that, the platforms that host our content are constantly in flux. Platforms can fall just as quickly as they can rise, either by just going completely offline or by making drastic changes to how people interact with content on their site/platform.
There are countless examples of this happening in the past and more recently the 2022 Twitter meltdown has led to some massive changes.</description>

      <description>A 3d platformer game with randomised powerup mechanics I made for my final year universirty dissertation project.
The game focus on giving players a different playthrough experience on each playthrough based on the powerups they acquired throughout each level.
These powerups affected player stats such as movement speed, jump height, and base attack damage. By manipulating these game elements, each playthrough of the game would be unique due to the randomness of the powerups that were presented in each level.</description>

      <description>TfL to Monzo was an severless application built as my project for my Cloud Computing module at university with a friend.
It was written in Python and made use of AWS Lambda to process TfL jounrey data into Monzo recipts.
The Lambda function would recieve incoming transcation webhook events from a linked Monzo account, check if they were TfL transcations and then run a web scraper script to extract the matching journey data from the TfL web portal before then submitting this data as a reciept to the Monzo receipt API endpoint.</description>
