      <description>I really enjoy reading books on my Kindle. I also buy most of my digital books via Amazon. I never really thought about making DRM free copies of my eBooks until I read about how an engineer had his Amazon account suspended due to a false claim from a delivery driver.
That really got me thinking about how I would feel if I lost access to my Amazon account. I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased most of my ebooks from Amazon.</description>
