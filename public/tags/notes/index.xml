      <description>One of the features I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked in Apple&amp;rsquo;s Safari web browser is the Safari Reader mode, which removes ads, navigation or other distracting elements from a web page.
This works perfectly for me on iOS but on my laptop, I mainly use Google Chrome and Arc for my web browsing.
Chrome has a reader type view hidden under chrome://flags and by then searching for &amp;lsquo;reading mode&amp;rsquo; but it&amp;rsquo;s still a bit complicated to enable and doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide the same view as Safari&amp;rsquo;s web browser.</description>

      <description>In addition to the articles, I’ve decided to add a notes section to the website now. There are times when I wanted to write a short piece about something but it didn’t feel right to put it in the articles section of the website.
Sometimes I just want to…note something down.
Hence the notes section!
What are notes meant to be? Notes will be short pieces of writing. Most likely a couple of lines long.</description>

      <description>You should be using an adblocker.
Not because ads are bad (although some are really annoying), but because even the FBI recommend using one for security now.
Use uBlock Origin and block those scam adverts that pop up at the top of search results.</description>
