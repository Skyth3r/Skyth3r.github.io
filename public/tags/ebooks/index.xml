      <description>I really enjoy reading books on my Kindle. I also buy most of my digital books via Amazon. I never thought about making DRM-free copies of my eBooks until I read about how an engineer has his Amazon account suspended due to a delivery driver&amp;rsquo;s false claim.
That really got me thinking about how I would feel if I lost access to my Amazon account. Iâ€™ve purchased most of my ebooks from Amazon.</description>
