        "content_html" : "\u003cp\u003eI really enjoy reading books on my Kindle. I also buy most of my digital books via Amazon. I never thought about making DRM-free copies of my eBooks until I read about how \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@bjax_/a-tale-of-unwanted-disruption-my-week-without-amazon-df1074e3818b\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ean engineer had his Amazon account suspended\u003c/a\u003e due to a delivery driver\u0026rsquo;s false claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat really got me thinking about how I would feel if I lost access to my Amazon account. I‚Äôve purchased most of my ebooks from Amazon. Losing access would mean losing the majority of my digital library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo avoid such a situation, I decided it was time to make a copy of the digital eBooks I purchased from Amazon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article covers how I removed the DRM from my Kindle ebooks so I can read my books on any device without needing to use a Kindle app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore going further, I‚Äôll answer some questions some folks might have üëáüèΩ\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"quick-frequently-asked-questions-faq\"\u003eQuick Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is DRM?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDRM stands for Digital Rights Management. It‚Äôs a type of tech used to control and manage access to copyrighted content. Its main purpose is to prevent content from being shared with those that did not pay for it and to also prevent the content from being modified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat issues does it pose?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile DRM is used to prevent piracy, it can cause issues for legitimate users as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, say you bought a video game that comes with some DRM that checks you own the game by contacting the game publisher‚Äôs server before you can play the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow imagine if the game publisher went out of business and with that, the server used for the DRM check goes offline with it. Now you‚Äôre in a situation where you‚Äôve paid for a video game but you can no longer access it due to the DRM server going offline (Also what if you just wanted to play the game offline/without an internet connection?).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigital books from Amazon, are only intended to be read on Kindle devices and via the Kindle app using your Amazon account. If you lost access to your Amazon account for any reason, you would essentially lose access to the books you bought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you care about removing DRM from your eBooks?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat‚Äôs simple. Not having DRM on your eBooks means you can read them on any device using any app you want without having to worry about losing access to your books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs it illegal to remove DRM from your digital items?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Just don‚Äôt distribute the DRM-free books you have as that would be illegal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"disclaimer\"\u003eDisclaimer\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere a several guides online that explain how to do this, I initially followed those methods but I got some errors when following these guides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow I‚Äôve listed the steps that worked for me. You might find that this exact approach might not work for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"prerequisites\"\u003ePrerequisites\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou‚Äôll need a Kindle eReader or the Kindle app on your machine. I personally used my Kindle eReader for this process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote - I use MacOS so these steps will be MacOS specific but the steps are similar if you are using a different operating system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"steps\"\u003eSteps\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFirst download \u003ca href=\"https://calibre-ebook.com\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eCalibre\u003c/a\u003e.

If you want a Kindle like e-reader without having to buy a Kindle, you might want to consider a \u003ca href=\"https://pocketbook.ch/en-ch\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ePocketbook\u003c/a\u003e instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"where-to-buy-ebooks-going-forward\"\u003eWhere to buy eBooks going forward\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can of course still buy your eBooks from Amazon, but it might be worth exploring what other options exist that allow you to get DRM free books way more easily. One of my favourites is a website called \u003ca href=\"https://www.hive.co.uk/eBooks\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eHive\u003c/a\u003e which sells eBooks in ePub and PDF formats by default and most books are similarly priced to their Amazon counterparts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat‚Äôs everything you should need to build a DRM-free digital library. All that‚Äôs left to do is to back up your eBooks somewhere (like a digital cloud provider) so you can always keep a copy of the books you bought).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1047875211730430527/Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-Mockup\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eArticle header image by Vyshnav Gangadharan under CC 4.0 license\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"

        "content_html" : "\u003cp\u003eI took 9 weeks off work. Of those 9 weeks, I spent 8 travelling. This is a summary of how I found my time off and what I did, things I learnt from my first long-term travel trip and my favourite highlights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-sabbatical-leave\"\u003eWhat is sabbatical leave?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quick 101 - sabbatical leave is an extended period of time away from work. Common reasons for taking sabbatical leave are to pursue interests outside of work; such as travelling, studying, volunteering or even just to take a break to just rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-did-i-get-my-sabbatical-leave\"\u003eHow did I get my sabbatical leave?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI work at a bank called \u003ca href=\"https://monzo.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eMonzo\u003c/a\u003e and about a year ago they introduced a new benefit. 3 months of paid sabbatical leave for those that had been at the company for 4 years. It just happens so that I was months away from hitting my 4 year work anniversary at the time of this announcement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, I did the logical thing and started planning how I would spend these 3 months away from work right away. In the end, I‚Äôve taken 9 weeks of sabbatical leave this year, with plans of using the remaining next year for another trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"terms-and-conditions\"\u003eTerms and Conditions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was the catch? It almost sounds too good to be true right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonestly, there was nothing that was of any concern. There were only two conditions I had to be aware of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first was that for the amount of time, I took as sabbatical leave, I needed to give double the length of that as my notice for taking the leave. Since I took 9 weeks off, I had to give 18 weeks of notice before taking the time off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other condition was that you‚Äôre required to keep working for the company for at least 6 months after taking sabbatical leave or I\u0026rsquo;d have to pay it back. Sounds pretty reasonable to me. I\u0026rsquo;m not planning on quitting anytime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-did-i-do-during-my-sabbatical\"\u003eWhat did I do during my sabbatical?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, I was really conflicted about what to do with my time off. Part of me really wanted to travel and another part of me wanted to stay at home and work on several projects I just never found the time for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, I decided to prioritise travelling and also make use of the credit card points/air miles I‚Äôd been saving up for the last 6 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a lot of planning, I ended up visiting 6 countries on my trip; The Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore. I went slowly through these countries to take the time to explore without feeling like I didn‚Äôt have enough time to do everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally my plan was to use all 3 months of sabbatical leave to travel across all of south-east Asia, Japan, South Korea and also Australia but it felt like I was trying to do too much in one trip. Adding locations like South Korea and Australia would have also made the trip expensive üí∏\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, I think travelling for 2 months instead of 3 was the right call. I started to feel a bit overwhelmed towards the end of the trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"travel-tips\"\u003eTravel Tips\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI‚Äôm not an expert when it comes to solo travelling and I‚Äôve never done a trip for this long before. The journey wasn‚Äôt always smooth and I managed to run into some problems along the way. Here‚Äôs what I think people should consider before travelling for long periods of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGet away from work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo truly immerse yourself while travelling, one of the first things I would consider doing is switching off from work (that is of course, if you didn‚Äôt quit your job to go and travel). No emails, no Slack or Microsoft Teams. Nothing. If you have a work laptop/phone, leave it at home. I personally just ended up logging out of my work email account and Slack and made sure I couldn‚Äôt log back in until after I got back from my trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePack less\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is something I had to learn the hard way. Avoid over-packing. Easier said than done. Learn how to pack efficiently, use some packing cubes and try and travel with a single bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn‚Äôt do that‚Ä¶it was difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, double-check where the nearest place to do laundry is before you need to do it. You‚Äôll thank yourself later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBonus tip\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e - If you are going to check-in some luggage for the flight, have a day or two\u0026rsquo;s worth of clothes/essentials in your carry-on. A friend that joined me in Japan had his suitcase lost by the airline. He did get it back in the end, but had to go a few days without his stuff üò¨\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBook flexible/refundable tickets, accommodation, etc.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can cost a little extra to choose the fully refundable/flexible but there are times when you‚Äôll be grateful you can just change your plans without any worries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up doing this myself, I changed my accommodation in Bali 2 nights before arriving and extended my stay in the areas I really enjoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot everything needs to be fully flexible, however. Flights are usually fine to not book as fully refundable. Most accommodation options in south-east Asia are really cheap so I booked everything as fully refundable (I only had to pay for the first night upfront and usually paid the rest on arrival).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat leads me to my next tip‚Ä¶\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon‚Äôt plan everything in advance\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt‚Äôs nice to have a plan and some things you definitely do need to book in advance. Not every day has to be planned down to the last minute, however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes it‚Äôs better to just embrace the randomness. That‚Äôs how I ended up doing some things I would never have considered, like trying out a sensory deprivation tank in Vietnam, climbing an active volcano at 4 am in the morning to watch the sunrise, or accidentally walking right into the Sanja Festival in Tokyo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou‚Äôll find more exciting things to do and see walking down random streets and by talking to people you encounter along the way on your trip. I certainly did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpend less time on your phone\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon‚Äôt get me wrong. Phones are the modern-day equivalent of a Swiss Army knife. They are incredibly useful but they can also be extremely distracting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt‚Äôs too easy to grab your phone and start scrolling through Instagram or TikTok when you‚Äôve got a spare moment. I try not to look at my phone too much when I‚Äôm travelling (I make an exception for when I need to contact people).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStay in hostels\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you‚Äôre solo travelling, hostels are the best place to stay in my opinion. It‚Äôs cheap, sociable, and overall just really fun. Most hostels also offer private rooms if you‚Äôre not keen on sharing a room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the most memorable moments from my trip from thanks to the friends I met along the way. Hostels are the perfect environment for meeting new people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrepare for things to go wrong\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn‚Äôt except so many things to go wrong on this trip.

Platforms can fall just as quickly as they can rise, either by just going \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/site-deaths\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ecompletely offline\u003c/a\u003e or by making drastic changes to how people interact with content on their site/platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are countless examples of this happening in the past and more recently the 2022 Twitter meltdown has led to some massive changes. One of these changes is that the newsletter platform Twitter acquired just two years ago, Revue is now \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/14/23509254/twitter-revue-shutdown-newsletter-data-deletion\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eshutting down\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"digital-platforms-are-fragile\"\u003eDigital platforms are fragile\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat‚Äôs partly why I‚Äôm writing this. The shutdown of Revue has been particularly frustrating for me as someone who moved their \u003ca href=\"https://akashandmoney.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003enewsletter\u003c/a\u003e from another newsletter service to Revue thinking it would be a better fit earlier this year. The announced shutdown left me scrambling to migrate my content and subscribers over the Christmas holidays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt just goes to show you the kind of problems we face when we trust third-party platforms to host our content. Thankfully I managed to export my content \u0026amp; subscribers in time, but that got me wondering\u0026hellip;How do I avoid this happening again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"owning-your-content\"\u003eOwning your content\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s time to start owning our digital content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter learning more about IndieWeb, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to follow their \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/principles\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ecommunity principles\u003c/a\u003e. The one that stood out to me was the principle of \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/own_your_data\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eowning your data\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo going forward I\u0026rsquo;ll be hosting more of my content here on this website where I don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about another platform dying out and losing my content. Hosting my content also gives me the ability to fully control how my website/content looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm quitting on using other platforms entirely but instead I plan on using this website to complement my activity on other digital platforms. You\u0026rsquo;ll likely see my cross-posting most of my content from here to these other platforms for visibility (A practice coined as \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/POSSE\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ePOSSE\u003c/a\u003e by IndieWeb).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-benefits-of-having-a-personal-website\"\u003eThe benefits of having a personal website\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a great number of benefits as to why you should have your own website but here are the reasons that really matter to me:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlatform independent\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the biggest reason for me at the moment. All my content is owned by me and hosted on my website, overall reducing my dependence on third-party platforms for content hosting. I won\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about my account being banned, I won\u0026rsquo;t have to migrate my data after another platform announces that it\u0026rsquo;s shutting down and I don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about a platform suddenly removing its free tier and demanding payment to continue using their services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, this website is built using a static site generator and hosted via \u003ca href=\"https://pages.github.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eGitHub Pages\u003c/a\u003e. In the future, if I wanted to change hosting platforms or the structure of this website, I have the full flexibility to do so all while maintaining access to my content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRobust \u0026amp; compact\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I\u0026rsquo;m using a static site generator for this website now, this has simplified a lot for me and has helped make the website a lot smaller and more compact. Due to its small size, I\u0026rsquo;m able to back up the entire site to several other code hosting/cloud storage platforms with ease. Currently, you can find this website on \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Skyth3r/Skyth3r.github.io\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eGitHub\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, using a static site generator has also done a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to SEO optimisation and has drastically improved the website\u0026rsquo;s load times as pointed out by this speed test üëáüèΩ\n\u003cimg src=\"/img/personal-website/pagespeed-insights-desktop-100.png\" alt=\"Pagespeed insights results desktop: 100% all pagespeed-insights-desktop-100-performace\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-to-expect-from-this-website\"\u003eWhat to expect from this website\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what can you expect from this website then?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m someone that has several interests and hobbies so I don\u0026rsquo;t want to box myself in with a particular theme or topic. My interests are not set in stone, and I expect them to change over time but there will likely be many recurring themes \u0026amp; topics I write about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, I plan on writing things around programming, tech, travel, video games, projects I\u0026rsquo;m working on, things I\u0026rsquo;m learning, life updates and anything else I find interesting or useful that I think is worth sharing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"this-is-not-a-blog\"\u003eThis is NOT a blog\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m kind of against the idea of calling this a blog.

Having a secondary space (almost like a second brain) for collecting and organising meaningful notes, thoughts and ideas can help free cognitive capacity, a bit like backing up your computer\u0026rsquo;s hard drive to cloud storage to free up memory on the local disk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have multiple digital gardens, scattered across \u003ca href=\"https://www.notion.so/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eNotion\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.instapaper.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eInstapaper\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://readwise.io/i/akash56\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eReadwise\u003c/a\u003e, etc, but this is the first one I\u0026rsquo;ll be publishing publicly as a centralised home to share what I find important to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much as this is for other people to read, this is also for me to reflect on myself and build upon existing ideas and thoughts of mine that would otherwise usually get lost among the various note-taking apps I use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"inspiration\"\u003eInspiration\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve thought about rebuilding my website for some time, but never got around to doing it.
