      <description>I really enjoy reading books on my Kindle. I also buy most of my digital books via Amazon. I never thought about making DRM-free copies of my eBooks until I read about how an engineer has his Amazon account suspended due to a delivery driver&amp;rsquo;s false claim.

      <description>My Hugo website uses the Digital Garden Hugo theme but I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few changes in addition to using the theme.

      <description>Please note
Due to issues with the theme, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to remove the code blocks from this article. The code is still present below but it&amp;rsquo;s not formatted as a code block. I&amp;rsquo;ll update this once this issue is fixed.
