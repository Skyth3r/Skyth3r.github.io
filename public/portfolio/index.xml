      <description>TfL to Monzo was an severless application built as my project for my Cloud Computing module at university with a friend.
It was written in Python and made use of AWS Lambda to process TfL jounrey data into Monzo recipts.
The Lambda function would recieve incoming transcation webhook events from a linked Monzo account, check if they were TfL transcations and then run a web scraper script to extract the matching journey data from the TfL web portal before then submitting this data as a reciept to the Monzo receipt API endpoint.</description>
