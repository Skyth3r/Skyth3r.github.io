# Hello, I'm Akash üëãüèΩ

## Welcome to my corner of the internet!

I'm a London based coffee fueled Cybersecurity Backend Engineer.

My interests include, but are not limited to: writing, [travelling](/tags/travel), [coding](https://akashgoswami.dev), video games, and a recent favourite of mine, archery!

This website is a home for everything I've learnt, enjoyed and things I've worked on. Basically it's my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) - An ever growing collection of my [notes](/notes), ideas, thoughts and more.

While you're here check out some of my [articles](/articles) or [what tools I use](/tools). You can also subscribe to new articles I post either via [RSS](https://akashgoswami.com/articles/index.xml) or via [email](https://buttondown.email/akashgoswami)!

### Want to contact me?

The best way to get in touch with me is probably via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/akashgoswami_) or {{< cloakemail address="akash@akashgoswami.com" display="email" >}}.
