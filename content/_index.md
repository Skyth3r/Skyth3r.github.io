# Hello, I'm Akash ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to my corner of the internet!

I'm a London based Security Analyst, that enjoys writing, travelling, video games and a whole lot more (I'm also a [massive personal finance nerd](https://akashandmoney.com/)).

This is a home for everything I'm interested in (which quite often changes from time to time). I'd like to think of it as a digital gardern (a type of personal wiki) but I guess I'm just going to see where this goes before putting a label on it right now.

While you're here check out some of my [articles](/articles) or my [stack](/stack)!
