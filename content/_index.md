# Hello, I'm Akash ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to my corner of the internet!

I'm a London based coffee fueled Security Analyst. My interests include (but are not limited to); writing, travelling, coding, video games, and a recent favourite of mine, archey!

This website is a home for everything I've learnt, enjoyed and things I've worked on. Basically it's my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) - An ever growing collection of my notes, ideas, thoughts and more

#### Want to contact me?

The best way to get in touch with me is probably via Twitter or email (both are listed in the menu bar of this website)

While you're here check out some of my [articles](/articles) or [what tools I use](/stack)!
