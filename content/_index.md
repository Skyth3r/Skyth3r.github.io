# Hello, I'm Akash 👋🏽

## Welcome to my corner of the internet!

I'm a London based coffee fueled Cybersecurity Specialist.

My interests include, but are not limited to: writing, travelling, coding, video games, and a recent favourite of mine, archery!

This website is a home for everything I've learnt, enjoyed and things I've worked on. Basically it's my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) - An ever growing collection of my notes, ideas, thoughts and more.

While you're here check out some of my [articles](/articles) or [what tools I use](/tools)!

### Want to contact me?

The best way to get in touch with me is probably via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/akashgoswami_) or [email](mailto:akash@akashgoswami.com).
