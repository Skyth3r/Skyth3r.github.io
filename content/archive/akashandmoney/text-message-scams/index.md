Hello folks, [Akash](https://twitter.com/akashgoswami_) here ðŸ‘‹

Today Iâ€™ve got something a bit different - This weekâ€™s newsletter comes in audio format ðŸ—£

I recently recorded a podcast episode with [Kia](https://twitter.com/ikeeyah_/) from the [Pennies to Pounds Podcast](https://twitter.com/PenniesToPound)!

Having worked in the disputes team at a bank, I shared what I knew about text message scams, how they work and how you can avoid & report them.

Check out the full episode here ðŸ‘‡

## TL;DL (Too Long, Didnâ€™t Listen)

No problem! Hereâ€™s a quick summary of what we discussed:

* Scammers get your phone numbers from past data breaches and use them to send you scam text messages
* Use [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to see if your data has been breached before
* Scam text messages will contain links to webforms that ask for your personal details
* [Learn how to spot phishing websites scams](https://monzo.com/blog/behind-the-scenes-of-a-phishing-scam)
* Scammers use the information from the webform to call you and convince you they are calling from your bank (or another organisation)
* Scammers try to convince you to move your money to a â€˜safe accountâ€™ or another account - This is just their own account
* Your bank will never ask you to move your money to another account
* If youâ€™ve been a victim of this scam, report it to your bank and [Action Fraud](https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/) 
* Report scam text messages by forwarding them to 7726
* Sign up for the [scam alerts newsletter](https://campaigns.which.co.uk/scam-alert-service/) from the Which? Group
