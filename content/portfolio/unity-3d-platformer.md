description: University dissertation project demostating the use of randomised game mechanics in a 3D platformer game
---

A 3d platformer game with randomised powerup mechanics I made for my final year universirty dissertation project. 

The game focus on giving players a different playthrough experience on each playthrough based on the powerups they acquired throughout each level.

These powerups affected player stats such as movement speed, jump height, and base attack damage. By manipulating these game elements, each playthrough of the game would be unique due to the randomness of the powerups that were presented in each level.

Additionally, this 3d platformer also featured a number of classic platformer game mechanics such as pick-up items (coins), moving platforms, enemies, obstacles and portals to teleport the player around different parts of each level.

Overall, this project recieved a 1st.
