One of the features I've always liked in Apple's Safari web browser is the [Safari Reader mode](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri32632/mac), which removes ads, navigation or other distracting elements from a web page.

This works perfectly for me on iOS but on my laptop, I mainly use Google Chrome and Arc for my web browsing. 

Chrome has a reader type view hidden under `chrome://flags` and by then searching for 'reading mode' but it's still a bit complicated to enable and doesn't provide the same view as Safari's web browser. 

It turns out, Arc for macOS has a hidden reader mode that can be enabled on a web page by pressing the `option + command + r` keys together which is much more similar to Safari's reader mode.

***Note*** - Arc's reader mode is still in beta but does a great job regardless
