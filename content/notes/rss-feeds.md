Recently I've been thinking a lot about RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds.

There's a lot of cool stuff you can do with RSS feeds. I read a post by Robb Knight, about how he [automated his now page](https://rknight.me/blog/automating-my-now-page/), which led to [Sophie automating her now page as well](https://localghost.dev/blog/everything-should-have-an-api-adventures-in-trying-to-automate-stuff/). I was thinking of how I could do the same using services that offer RSS feeds. 

I would love to be able to automate the Movies, TV Shows and Video Games sections of my now page. So far I've found that Letterboxd offers an RSS feed for movies and Backloggd offers an RSS feed for a user's reviewed games but not for their 'Currently playing' games. I'm still exploring what would be the best solution to use for books and TV shows. 

Currently, I use [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) as my RSS Reader app.

Another cool project I found recently was [RSS Parrot](https://rss-parrot.net/) by [GÃ¡bor Ugray](https://genart.social/@twilliability). RSS Parrot allows you to subscribe to RSS feeds directly via Mastodon. 

In addition to that, it's possible to also subscribe to Bluesky profiles using RSS parrot via Bluesky's [new RSS feeds feature](https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3kh5rjl6bgu2i) that was introduced at the end of 2023 and with Meta's plan to [add ActivityPub integration to Threads](https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/24000120/threads-meta-activitypub-test-mastodon), I might be able to finally follow all my friends across the internet via one account!

Twitter doesn't have native RSS feed support but I've managed to find a workaround using [Nitter](https://nitter.net/) (**Note** - RSS feeds are currently disabled on the main Nitter instance at the moment. There are other instances where RSS feeds are still enabled.)

Overall, the future for an open web is looking bright.
