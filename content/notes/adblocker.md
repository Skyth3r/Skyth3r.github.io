You should be using an adblocker. 

Not because ads are bad (although some are really annoying), but because even [the FBI recommend using one for security](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/22/fbi-ad-blocker/?guccounter=1) now.

Use [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) and block those scam adverts that pop up at the top of search results.
