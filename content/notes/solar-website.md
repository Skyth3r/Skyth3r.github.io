Last month I came across a quirky little website.

[Low Tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/) is a website that explores forgotten tech and energy sustainability. 

Articles on the website are split into three main categories; [Low-tech solutions](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/low-tech-solutions/), [High-tech problems](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/high-tech-problems/) and [Obsolete Technology](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/obsolete-technology/). 

My favourite part. It's a solar powered website ☀️

Occasionally the website goes down when it's not sunny enough in Barcelona (where the web server is based) and the backup battery has run dry.

What do you do when you want to read articles from the website and the site is down? Well you can access the site's content offline...as [physical books](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/offline-reading/)!

It's such a interesting take on websites that I really like the idea of.

My favourite article from the website so far - [Can We Make Bicycles Sustainable Again?](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2023/02/can-we-make-bicycles-sustainable-again/).
