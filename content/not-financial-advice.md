title: Not Financial Advice
---

Hi there, if you're reading this page, then you've likely got here via a page related to personal finance, investing, etc that I have on my website or something I said elsewhere. 

This is a disclaimer to make it clear that all information, opinions and suggestions shared on my website or anywhere else are for educational and entertainment purposes only.

I try to provide accurate information, but there's always a chance for errors or inaccuracies. You should always do your own research. 

If you need financial advice, please consider speaking to a professional financial advisor (which I am not).

Have a great day!
