## General Tips

* If you have an iPhone, add a Suica card to your Apple Wallet and then add it to Express Mode via the settings. This lets you tap in and out of most public transport extremely quickly. You can also use the for payments in a number of stores and topping it up is done within seconds from the Apple Wallet app.
* Note down the 7-11 locations near where you're staying. They are open 24/7 and all have an ATM that accepts all international bank cards (great for when you need to make a cash withdrawal)
