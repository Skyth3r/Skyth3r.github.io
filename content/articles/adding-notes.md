description: Adding a notes section to the website
tags: ['update']
---

In addition to the articles, I’ve decided to add a notes section to the website now. There are times when I wanted to write a short piece about something but it didn’t feel right to put it in the articles section of the website. 

Sometimes I just want to…note something down.

***Hence the [notes section](/notes)!***

## What are notes meant to be?

Notes will be short pieces of writing. Most likely a couple of lines long.  

They’ll basically be my equivalent of a tweet.

If a note ends up getting too long, I might decide to nudge it over to the articles section.
