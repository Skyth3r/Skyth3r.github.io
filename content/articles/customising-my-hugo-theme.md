My Hugo website uses the [Digital Garden Hugo theme](https://github.com/apvarun/digital-garden-hugo-theme) but I've made a few changes in addition to using the theme. I've listed these changes below both for myself to refer back to and for anyone else that might find these useful to include in their own Hugo website üëáüèΩ

## Updating lastmod text
One of the first changes I made was to change the lastmod front matter text that was displayed on the theme. Previously it would default to showing `Pruned January 2, 2023` on articles with the `lastmod` front matter. After my change to the article single layout it now instead shows `Last tended to on January 2, 2023`.

## Additional Article Front Matter
I ended up adding a few new improvements to the article front matter.

### Article read time
Added a read time for articles. This is automatically generated and listed for each article item. This is based on the code found [here](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/readingtime-define/13036/4).

### Tags
I wanted to be able to nagivate my site articles by tags, so I've added tags to each article and updated the autogenerated tags page (was previously blank) as well. The code from the tags page is currently just copied from the theme's [portfolio layout](https://github.com/apvarun/digital-garden-hugo-theme/tree/main/layouts/portfolio). It's not perfect but it works for now.

## rel-me verifcation
Modified the social icons sidebar code to include rel=me. Used for [verification on Mastodon](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/#verification).

## 404 page copy
Added some copy to the 404 page (was previously a blank page).

## Buy me a coffee widget
Added a buy me a coffee widget to each article page by creating a new partial shortcode.
